Elbette, bir önceki değerlendirmenin (Evaluation) tüm önerilerini uygulayan, tamamen İngilizce, son ve geliştirilmiş README.md açıklamasını aşağıda bulabilirsiniz.Bu versiyon, projenizin profesyonelliğini ve teknik derinliğini maksimize eder.📝 Final, Enhanced README.md Description🛠️ DotNet-OSINT-Toolkit: Advanced Investigation APIThis repository hosts a robust, multi-vector Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) API developed using ASP.NET Core. Designed as a toolkit, it centralizes and automates complex investigative queries, allowing security analysts and researchers to gather comprehensive data from a single, unified endpoint.✨ Core FeaturesMulti-Modal Searching: The API intelligently processes and handles diverse queries, including usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, domains, phone numbers, and cryptocurrency addresses.Platform Aggregation: Performs presence checks for usernames across a wide array of social media, developer, and community platforms.Query Sanitization: Automatically removes whitespace from usernames (e.g., "anar amanli" -> "aramanli") before lookup to ensure cleaner, more effective platform searches.Risk Profiling: Calculates a basic Risk Score based on the number of confirmed profile hits, aiding in rapid assessment.Network Intelligence: Offers dedicated endpoints for IP Geolocation and Domain DNS/WHOIS lookups.Extensible Architecture: Built on C# and .NET, the controller structure is easily extensible for adding new OSINT sources, custom scrapers, or third-party API integrations.💻 Tech StackComponentTechnologyDescriptionCore FrameworkASP.NET CoreUsed for building a fast, modern RESTful API.LanguageC#The primary development language.LibrariesSystem.Net.Http, System.Text.RegularExpressionsUtilized for making external HTTP requests and input validation/sanitization.🚀 Getting StartedThis project requires the .NET SDK to run locally.Installation & ExecutionClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/anaramanli/DotNet-OSINT-Toolkit.git
cd DotNet-OSINT-Toolkit
Restore dependencies and run the application:Bashdotnet run
The API will typically start on http://localhost:5000 (or as configured in your launch settings).📤 Example Request PayloadTo use the powerful, comprehensive /api/osint/investigate endpoint, send a POST request with the following JSON structure:JSON{
    "query": "test", 
    "search_social_media": true,
    "search_emails": true,
    "search_ip": false,
    "search_forums": true
}
